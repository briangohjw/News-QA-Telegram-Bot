september.paul mccartney says he 's looking forward to playing a concert in israel next month.the show , which will be held september 25 in tel aviv , had been rumored for months.promoters are saying it will be one of the biggest concerts ever held in israel , and they hope it will encourage other top stars to come to israel.a web site offering tickets for the concert put prices at 1,500 shekels and 490 shekels or between $ 426.86 and $ 139.44 u.s. dollars.israelis \" will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for , \" a news release on mccartney 's web site announced wednesday.two plane loads of equipment will be arriving with around 100 mccartney production people . the concert will cost around $ 10 million to produce and the organizers said they are hoping to make a profit.in the mid-1960s , when the fab four from liverpool , england , ruled the music charts , a concert in israel was proposed . it never happened.the long-told story maintained that beatlemania was deemed too potentially injurious to israel 's youth . a more recent theory , however , blamed the ban on a tiff between competing concert promoters.whatever the reason , israelis never got to experience the beatles live.earlier this year , israel 's ambassador to britain , ron prosor , visited liverpool and apologized to the beatles for the \" misunderstanding . \" in a letter prosor wrote : \" there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you , who shaped the minds of the generation , to come to

celebrate her 80th birthday , so if a woman is able to become pregnant using in vitro fertilization with a donor egg at 56 , she could still watch her child grow into an adult . but just because it 's possible , does that mean she should ? some feel that having children after 45 is unfair because the parents might not live to see the kids become adults.the death of 69-year-old maria del carmen bousada of spain , who used in vitro fertilization with a donor egg to have twin boys at 66 , has the fertility treatment community bracing for a backlash . it could rival the fallout from octuplet mom nadya suleman -- and it seems to have already started.in a national online survey about fertility conducted in may by johnson &amp; johnson 's babycenter.com , 7 out of 10 moms who responded wanted tougher regulation laws for ivf treatments , and half of the 1,095 respondents thought it was bad for the children if a parent conceived past 45.fertility specialists understand those concerns , but they say it 's not that simple . although it 's rare for anyone older than 55 to get the go-ahead for ivf , that guideline is peer-enforced rather than mandated , and decisions typically are made on a case-by-case basis.georgia dardick , an advertising executive in boynton beach , florida , was one of those cases . dardick tried to conceive via ivf six times and seriously considered adoption , but at 51 , she was n't ready to let go of her desire to have a baby . \" fifty was the cutoff for my doctor , but they agreed to give us one more try , \" she said . she had her daughter in january.dardick said she never planned to have a baby at 51 , but feels that she made the right decision , despite the judgments others may have . \" the word selfish has come into my mind . but for any parent , having a child is selfish . no matter what your age is , once you have that child , you owe that child everything . i live the best , healthiest life i can . \" doctors say society 's views of aging needs to change . \" the 40 and 45-year-old of today is not the 40-year-old of the past ; the 50-year-old [ today ] is not the same of the past , \" said dr. john jain , a physician at the santa monica ( california ) fertility clinic who has treated age-related infertility for 15 years . \" they 're eating healthy . a woman who is 45 is barely halfway through [ her ] life . \" healthy or not , having a child at that age can cause tremendous stress on the body.candidates for ivf after 45 use either an egg donor or their own frozen embryos from a prior cycle and are screened for underlying medical problems , such as diabetes , obesity , hypertension or lung disease , said dr. charles coddington of the mayo clinic 's reproductive endocrinology department in rochester , minnesota.still , \" if somebody were in good health , it would be hard to say , 'you should n't have a baby , ' \" he said . \" one has to judge where they are , health-wise and financially . \" but if a woman who claims to be 55 is actually in her mid-60s -- as bousada reportedly did -- what 's a doctor to do ? not much , physicians say . watch report on death of 69-year-old mother » \" the truth may get dimmed to fit into the realm of a patient that may be acceptable . i do n't sit there and say , 'go get your birth certificate . ' if someone 's coming in and they 're saying they 're 52 or 55 , i take it at face value , \" coddington said , who does refer questionable cases to the fertility center 's ethics board.even for those who choose to use it , the availability of this technology can be a double-edged sword.dardick said she would n't change anything , but if she did have to do it all over again , she said she may have considered adoption earlier . \" in a way , there 's this hope always out there for you , and once you get into it , it 's harder to break away , \" she said.it 's the intense desire to have a biological child that manhattan-based psychotherapist joan wingroad , who specializes in fertility issues for women 40 and older , has been treating for 20 years . \" i work with women who 've been very successful . they went to the right schools , got married and they feel that everything comes to you if you work hard . but then they realize pregnancy does n't happen that way , \" said wingroad.she helps her clients find balance -- and limits -- by creating a plan : how long should they try ivf ? how long until they consider adoption or child-free living ? \" they need that . \" wingroad said , \" because many times a doctor will say , 'look , this is your money , this is your dream ; who am i to say that you ca n't do it anymore . ' \" while doctors do help women try to reach their dream , jain said he is n't afraid to tell a patient \" no \" if they simply are n't healthy enough -- or are just too old . but , jain said , it 's

woman can live long enough to celebrate her 80th birthday  so if a woman is able to become pregnant using in vitro fertilization with a donor egg at 56  she could still watch her child grow into an adult  but just because it s possible  does that mean she should  some feel that having children after 45 is unfair because the parents might not live to see the kids become adultsthe death of 69yearold maria del carmen bousada of spain  who used in vitro fertilization with a donor egg to have twin boys at 66  has the fertility treatment community bracing for a backlash  it could rival the fallout from octuplet mom nadya suleman  and it seems to have already startedin a national online survey about fertility conducted in may by johnson  johnson s babycentercom  7 out of 10 moms who responded wanted tougher regulation laws for ivf treatments  and half of the 1095 respondents thought it was bad for the children if a parent conceived past 45fertility specialists understand those concerns  but they say it s not that simple  although it s rare for anyone older than 55 to get the goahead for ivf  that guideline is peerenforced rather than mandated  and decisions typically are made on a casebycase basisgeorgia dardick  an advertising executive in boynton beach  florida  was one of those cases  dardick tried to conceive via ivf six times and seriously considered adoption  but at 51  she was nt ready to let go of her desire to have a baby   fifty was the cutoff for my doctor  but they agreed to give us one more try   she said  she had her daughter in januarydardick said she never planned to have a baby at 51  but feels that she made the right decision  despite the judgments others may have   the word selfish has come into my mind  but for any parent  having a child is selfish  no matter what your age is  once you have that child  you owe that child everything  i live the best  healthiest life i can   doctors say society s views of aging needs to change   the 40 and 45yearold of today is not the 40yearold of the past  the 50yearold  today  is not the same of the past   said dr john jain  a physician at the santa monica  california  fertility clinic who has treated agerelated infertility for 15 years   they re eating healthy  a woman who is 45 is barely halfway through  her  life   healthy or not  having a child at that age can cause tremendous stress on the bodycandidates for ivf after 45 use either an egg donor or their own frozen embryos from a prior cycle and are screened for underlying medical problems  such as diabetes  obesity  hypertension or lung disease  said dr charles coddington of the mayo clinic s reproductive endocrinology department in rochester  minnesotastill   if somebody were in good health  it would be hard to say  you should nt have a baby    he said   one has to judge where they are  healthwise and financially   but if a woman who claims to be 55 is actually in her mid60s  as bousada reportedly did  what s a doctor to do  not much  physicians say  watch report on death of 69yearold mother »  the truth may get dimmed to fit into the realm of a patient that may be acceptable  i do nt sit there and say  go get your birth certificate   if someone s coming in and they re saying they re 52 or 55  i take it at face value   coddington said  who does refer questionable cases to the fertility center s ethics boardeven for those who choose to use it  the availability of this technology can be a doubleedged sworddardick said she would nt change anything  but if she did have to do it all over again  she said she may have considered adoption earlier   in a way  there s this hope always out there for you  and once you get into it  it s harder to break away   she saidit s the intense desire to have a biological child

to the right schools  got married and they feel that everything comes to you if you work hard  but then they realize pregnancy does nt happen that way   said wingroadshe helps her clients find balance  and limits  by creating a plan  how long should they try ivf  how long until they consider adoption or childfree living   they need that   wingroad said   because many times a doctor will say  look  this is your money  this is your dream  who am i to say that you ca nt do it anymore    while doctors do help women try to reach their dream  jain said he is nt afraid to tell a patient  no  if they

revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , \" ultralight \" airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the u.s. department of justice said in a news release.there was no immediate public response from bout , who remains in custody in thailand.federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill u.s. nationals , conspiracy to kill u.s. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.farc is designated a terrorist organization by the u.s. state department.justice department officials said they are seeking bout 's extradition to the united states.the indictment alleges that bout made agreements with farc between november 2007 and march of this year.in their news release , federal prosecutors said bout agreed to sell weapons \" to two confidential sources \" working with the u.s. drug enforcement administration , who had \" represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the farc , with the specific

new leaders will awaken friday morning to the nation-building equivalent of a huge pile of dirty and broken dishes in the kitchen , not to mention a few bitter guests who are n't quite ready to leave , experts say.although gadhafi 's death will probably end the possibility of an insurgency that could have sapped the new government 's time and energy , it will do little to heal the myriad divisions within the country , said fawaz gerges , director of the middle east centre at the london school of economics . \" the challenges are much greater than basically the celebration we are seeing today in western capitals , \" he said . \" and i think the morning after , we will wake up to a libya that has changed very little in terms of really mending the rifts inside the country itself . \" libyans celebrate death of longtime dictatorthose rifts include sharp divisions among rebel groups , such as leaders in the western city of misrata who have refused to recognize the eastern-based national transitional council as the country 's new government , gerges said.and with gadhafi dead , the primary unifying force that held the rebels together is gone , according to stratfor analyst kamran bokhari . \" the one thing that held all the rebels together was the presence of moammar gadhafi , even though the rebels had taken the capital and the focus was to essentially put down any form of pro-gadhafi resistance wherever it may be , especially in his hometown , sirte , \" bokhari said.with that accomplished , the question for the rebels becomes whether they will be able to stick together and not \" descend into a situation of chaos and civil war , \" he said.as for what could happen to libya after gadhafi , gerges said , look no farther than egypt . the world celebrated with that nation 's people in february when intense demonstrations against the rule of longtime leader hosni mubarak forced him to relinquish power.several months later , the country is ruled by a military council , and fierce political struggles dominate . \" the same thing applies to libya , \" gerges said . \" in fact , libya is much more divided than egypt or even yemen , \" another arab state that has witnessed protests against its leaders ' rule.the national transitional council has achieved remarkable progress since taking power , said daniel serwer , a senior fellow at the center for transatlantic relations at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies . \" it got the electricity and water flowing ; they 've got the ( financial ) markets open . they 've got police on the street and even garbagemen collecting the garbage , \" serwer said . \" that is brilliant . \" but many challenges remain.figuring out how to create a sense of national reconciliation in a country where few civil institutions survived gadhafi 's rule is but one urgent task for the country 's new government , experts said.it must also deal with armed militias , restore basic services nationwide , make sure things such as gadhafi 's chemical weapons stores are secured and tackle the mammoth tasks of creating a new constitution and government and scheduling elections.leaders also have to figure out how to deal with the trials of gadhafi regime members suspected of being involved in war crimes and address concerns of international human rights groups who fear that former rebels are mistreating and torturing prisoners.the national transitional council has put off dealing with many of those issues since toppling gadhafi 's regime , said fadel laman , president of the american-libyan council.but with the former ruler dead and the last city loyal to him under government control , the nation 's new leaders can no longer use war to explain any lack of progress to the libyan people , laman said . \" there is no gadhafi for them to use as a crutch , \" he said.cnn 's melissa gray contributed to this report .

of 14,630 square miles ( 37,900 sq km ) of fishing waters.its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the pacific ocean.analysts say peru will have its day in court and the hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved , unless something happens to escalate the debate . \" the only thing that could happen , which would be very worrisome , would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty ( in those waters ) now that peru officially claims them . that would be a shame , \" said ricardo israel , a political analyst in chile.chile defeated peru in the 1879-1883 war of the pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor . the two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky.the dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco , a grape liquor.peru and chile are the world 's top producers of fish meal , a cattle feed , and fishing is one of the engines of peru 's economy . e-mail to a friend

attack on a danish political cartoonist \" runs totally against the teachings and values of islam , \" the umbrella organization representing muslim countries has said.if the attack was a reaction to kurt westergaard 's drawing of the muslim prophet mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb , \" then it should be rejected and condemned by all muslims , \" the organization of the islamic conference said in a statement sunday.an ax-wielding somali man is accused of trying to break into westergaard 's home friday and was charged the next day with attempted assassination . intelligence officials linked the suspect to an east african islamist militia allied with al qaeda.the suspect tried to kill westergaard and an on-duty police officer , the danish intelligence and security service said.danish police shot the 28-year-old suspect friday night as he tried to enter westergaard 's home in the city of aarhus.the suspect was shot in the right leg and left hand . he was hospitalized after the incident . video showed him appearing at court strapped to a stretcher.authorities did not identify him because the judge decided it would be illegal to disclose his name , said chief superintendent ole madsen with the east jutland police . they said he has legal residency in denmark and lives in sjaelland , near copenhagen.the judge ordered the suspect held for four weeks while the investigation proceeds . madsen said the man is currently the only suspect in the case , and he would not say whether police were investigating anyone else.al-shabaab , the militant organization with alleged ties to the suspect , is waging a bloody battle against somalia 's transitional government and is currently on a u.s. government list of terrorist organizations.at a news conference in the somali capital of mogadishu , al-shabaab spokesman sheikh ali mohamud rage said , \" we are very happy with the somali national who attacked the house of the danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet mohammed . this is an honor for the somali people . we are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults islam should be attacked wherever they are . \" police had no indication that an attack was being planned on westergaard , madsen said , though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links.police said the suspect wielded an ax and a knife and managed to crack the glass front door of westergaard 's home . a home alarm alerted police to the scene , and they were attacked by the suspect , authorities said.westergaard , who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in , hid in a \" panic room \" when he realized what was happening , madsen said . westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home , but nobody was on guard at the house friday , the security and intelligence service told cnn.police said westergaard was \" being taken care of \" after the break-in , but would n't reveal his new location.the incident \" once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against denmark and against cartoonist kurt westergaard , in particular , \" said jakob scharf , spokesman for the danish security and intelligence service.westergaard 's caricature of mohammed -- showing the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse -- was first published by the danish newspaper morgenavisen jyllands-posten in september 2005. it sparked an uproar among muslims in early 2006 after newspapers reprinted the images in support of free speech.at the time , westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism . however , many in the muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist.over the years , danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against westergaard 's life.after three such arrests in february 2008 , westergaard issued a statement , saying , \" of course i fear for my life after the danish security and intelligence service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me . however , i have turned fear into anger and indignation . it has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which i used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness . \" scharf said authorities have taken measures to ensure westergaard 's safety , and that the protection has \" proven effective . \" -- cnn 's per nyberg and reporter mohamed amiin adow contributed to this report .

israel , paul mccartney has announced he 'll perform there in september.paul mccartney says he 's looking forward to playing a concert in israel next month.the show , which will be held september 25 in tel aviv , had been rumored for months.promoters are saying it will be one of the biggest concerts ever held in israel , and they hope it will encourage other top stars to come to israel.a web site offering tickets for the concert put prices at 1,500 shekels and 490 shekels or between $ 426.86 and $ 139.44 u.s. dollars.israelis \" will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for , \" a news release on mccartney 's web site announced wednesday.two plane loads of equipment will be arriving with around 100 mccartney production people . the concert will cost around $ 10 million to produce and the organizers said they are hoping to make a profit.in the mid-1960s , when the fab four from liverpool , england , ruled the music charts , a concert in israel was proposed . it never happened.the long-told story maintained that beatlemania was deemed too potentially injurious to israel 's youth . a more recent theory , however , blamed the ban on a tiff between competing concert promoters.whatever the reason , israelis never got to experience the beatles live.earlier this year , israel 's ambassador to britain , ron prosor , visited liverpool and apologized to the beatles for the \" misunderstanding . \" in a letter prosor wrote : \" there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you , who shaped the minds of the generation , to come to israel and perform . \" mccartney and ringo starr are the only surviving beatles . john lennon was slain by a deranged gunman in 1980 ; george harrison died of cancer in 2001.mccartney is billing the tel aviv show his \" friendship first \" concert . \" i 've heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel , but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another , \" mccartney said in the news release . \" we are planning to have a great time and a great evening . we ca n't wait to get out there and rock . \"

defending pakistan 's rural poor from a ruling elite that they describe as corrupt and oppressive.mohammed daoud , with his son faisal , is among those who have embraced the taliban 's message.that message has been resonating throughout the pakistani countryside , where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor.in farmlands just 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) from the center of islamabad , mohammed daoud and his 15-year-old son faisal eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo . they feed their family of seven , earning the equivalent of around $ 50 a month by selling buffalo milk . two months ago , daoud said , the government bulldozed his family 's house , probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own . \" justice [ in pakistan ] is only for people who have money , \" daoud said , while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe . \" we are illiterate , \" he added , \" but we are hoping that with islamic sharia law , our lives will get better . \" across this overwhelmingly muslim country , there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the koran will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line . watch why the taliban 's message would resonateenforcement of sharia law is the platform the taliban have been using to justify recent land-grabs , such as last week 's armed occupation of the district of buner , some 60 miles from the pakistani capital.in an interview with cnn , muslim khan , the taliban spokesman in the militant stronghold of swat valley , denounced the pakistani government , calling the prime minister and lawmakers \" un-islamic . \" \" they 're making money like in a supermarket , \" khan said , adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally.militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern pakistan by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats , according to amnesty international , the human rights watchdog . \" its systematic . the taliban move into an area , they use local existing resentments . they often go in with the guise of being robin hoods , \" said amnesty international representative sam zarifi . \" they scare away some local thieves , they impose very , very quick justice , very harsh justice , and initially in some places they are even welcomed . \" the taliban 's promise of islamic justice would be welcomed in farm fields on the outskirts of islamabad . rows of wheat -- along with the posh villas of pakistan 's ruling elite -- are within sight of islamabad 's iconic white faisal mosque . \" in the present judicial system , even the innocent people are punished , \" said sajeet hussein , as he and a group of farmers shared lunch under the shade of a tree . the group explained that they were losing a court battle to stop the government from seizing their land , because they claimed they could n't afford to bribe policemen and judges . \" every part of the country should have sharia law , like in saudi arabia , \" said hussein 's brother babar , who sported a long bushy beard . \" then poor and rich people will be equal . \" \" we love the taliban , \" announced one pashtun farmer who asked not to be named . he called the militants heroes.sports star-turned-politician imran khan summed up his response to the taliban in pakistan by saying , \" the poorer section of society is joining them ... this is now developing into a battle between the 'haves ' and the 'have-nots . ' \" what the taliban are giving them is cheap -- in fact , free -- accessible justice at the village level , \" he added . \" this is what pakistan should be doing for its own people . \" but if farmer babar hussein has his way , taliban justice would mean taking away freedoms from pakistani women , like the right to have a driver 's license . \" women should not even come out of their houses . that 's against islam \" he said , while complaining about the un-islamic fashions he saw women wearing in islamabad.when taliban militants overran buner last week , they told women to stay indoors , warned men to stop shaving their beards , and threatened shopkeepers who sold movies and music.in pakistan 's rural society , male strangers are not even supposed look at local women . and yet , some farmers enjoy blaring bollywood music and even dancing on trailers full of hay , while driving their gaudily-decorated tractors.if the taliban 's rural revolt succeeds , it could bring silence to the pakistani countryside .

's manhattan island -- is drifting slowly toward australia , scientists said wednesday.the iceberg , measuring 140 square km ( 54 square miles ) , cleaved off an ice shelf nearly 10 years ago and had been floating near antarctica before commencing on its unusual journey north.named b17b , it was about 1,700 km ( 1,056 miles ) off the coast of west australia , according to the country 's antarctic division . \" b17b is a very significant one in that it has drifted so far north while still largely intact , \" said australian antarctic division glaciologist neal young , who spotted the slab using satellite images taken by nasa and the european space agency . \" it 's one of the biggest sighted at those latitudes . \" it is unlikely to drift too close to the coast in its current form , young said . the warmer waters will cause it to melt . \" as the water warms up , the iceberg is slowly breaking up , resulting in hundreds more smaller icebergs in the area , \" young said on the australian antarctic division web site.in november , an iceberg estimated to be 500 meters wide and 50 meters high was spotted close to macquarie island in the southern pacific drifting towards new zealand.scientists working on the island were astounded by its size . \" we pulled out the binoculars that we use for work on the seals and , sure enough , it was a huge floating island of ice basically and , yeah , it was an incredible sight , \" australian researcher dean miller told cnn affiliate tvnz.the australian antarctic division said the iceberg was part of a flotilla that would have broken off from a larger ice flow that possibly came from the ross ice shelf , antarctica 's largest.although shipping lanes in this region are not particularly busy in november , the icebergs prompted maritime new zealand to issue navigation warnings.three years earlier , another family of icebergs led to a small tourist boom when they drifted along the east coast of new zealand 's south island.oceanographer mike williams told radio new zealand the icebergs had \" pretty much the same origin \" but that some had probably been trapped in the icy seas of antarctica for longer , before being carried north by the currents.however he was reluctant to cite global warming as the reason for the large-scale movement of ice . \" we do have to a change our position a little because in 2006 we thought this was a 'once in a lifetime ' event . \" but large ice shelf carvings , where the ice comes from , are still only carving on a 30 to 50-year period . \"

) -- the average american woman can live long enough to celebrate her 80th birthday , so if a woman is able to become pregnant using in vitro fertilization with a donor egg at 56 , she could still watch her child grow into an adult . but just because it 's possible , does that mean she should ? some feel that having children after 45 is unfair because the parents might not live to see the kids become adults.the death of 69-year-old maria del carmen bousada of spain , who used in vitro fertilization with a donor egg to have twin boys at 66 , has the fertility treatment community bracing for a backlash . it could rival the fallout from octuplet mom nadya suleman -- and it seems to have already started.in a national online survey about fertility conducted in may by johnson & johnson 's babycenter.com , 7 out of 10 moms who responded wanted tougher regulation laws for ivf treatments , and half of the 1,095 respondents thought it was bad for the children if a parent conceived past 45.fertility specialists understand those concerns , but they say it 's not that simple . although it 's rare for anyone older than 55 to get the go-ahead for ivf , that guideline is peer-enforced rather than mandated , and decisions typically are made on a case-by-case basis.georgia dardick , an advertising executive in boynton beach , florida , was one of those cases . dardick tried to conceive via ivf six times and seriously considered adoption , but at 51 , she was n't ready to let go of her desire to have a baby . \" fifty was the cutoff for my doctor , but they agreed to give us one more try , \" she said . she had her daughter in january.dardick said she never planned to have a baby at 51 , but feels that she made the right decision , despite the judgments others may have . \" the word selfish has come into my mind . but for any parent , having a child is selfish . no matter what your age is , once you have that child , you owe that child everything . i live the best , healthiest life i can . \" doctors say society 's views of aging needs to change . \" the 40 and 45-year-old of today is not the 40-year-old of the past ; the 50-year-old [ today ] is not the same of the past , \" said dr. john jain , a physician at the santa monica ( california ) fertility clinic who has treated age-related infertility for 15 years . \" they 're eating healthy . a woman who is 45 is barely halfway through [ her ] life . \" healthy or not , having a child at that age can cause tremendous stress on the body.candidates for ivf after 45 use either an egg donor or their own frozen embryos from a prior cycle and are screened for underlying medical problems , such as diabetes , obesity , hypertension or lung disease , said dr. charles coddington of the mayo clinic 's reproductive endocrinology department in rochester , minnesota.still , \" if somebody were in good health , it would be hard to say , 'you should n't have a baby , ' \" he said . \" one has to judge where they are , health-wise and financially . \" but if a woman who claims to be 55 is actually in her mid-60s -- as bousada reportedly did -- what 's a doctor to do ? not much , physicians say . watch report on death of 69-year-old mother » \" the truth may get dimmed to fit into the realm of a patient that may be acceptable . i do n't sit there and say , 'go get your birth certificate . ' if someone 's coming in and they 're saying they 're 52 or 55 , i take it at face value , \" coddington said , who does refer questionable cases to the fertility center 's ethics board.even for those who choose to use it , the availability of this technology can be a double-edged sword.dardick said she would n't change anything , but if she did have to do it all over again , she said she may have considered adoption earlier . \" in a way , there 's this hope always out there for you , and once you get into it , it 's harder to break away , \" she said.it 's the intense desire to have a biological child that manhattan-based psychotherapist joan wingroad , who specializes in fertility issues for women 40 and older , has been treating for 20 years . \" i work with women who 've been very successful . they went to the right schools , got married and they feel that everything comes to you if you work hard . but then they realize pregnancy does n't happen that way , \" said wingroad.she helps her clients find balance -- and limits -- by creating a plan : how long should they try ivf ? how long until they consider adoption or child-free living ? \" they need that . \" wingroad said , \" because many times a doctor will say , 'look , this is your money , this is your dream ; who am i to say that you ca n't do it anymore . ' \" while doctors do help women try to reach their dream , jain said he is n't afraid to tell a patient \" no \" if they simply are n't healthy enough -- or are just too old . but , jain said , it 's all based on his judgment as a trained physician . \" ninety-five percent of us do a great job about regulating ourselves . i personally do n't want to see more regulation , because it becomes problematic , and it can be more costly . someone who 's failed three cycles and [ has already spent ] $ 50,000 -- with the next cycle , will i be more aggressive ? certainly , \" jain said . \" but maybe there 's a middle ground , if the rule is that donor ivf will not be offered for women over 55 years of age . regulations at the extremes might be useful . \" even though dardick plans on living her life as a new mom for quite some time , she said having a baby at her age is n't ideal . she and her husband are taking careful precautions by adjusting their financial planning to make sure their daughter will be financially secure.they 're also tightening bonds with extended family and friends , should anything happen to her or her husband -- a decision bousada may have made as well , as her twin boys are now in the custody of a relative.those , dardick said , are the decisions one has to make when having a child later in life . \" \" people feel that it 's not fair to the child because you may not live long enough , \" dardick said . but as someone who lost a father as a teenager , she knows \" there are no guarantees in life . \"  ...  3        \n","\n","[100 rows x 10

to deal with cholesterol problem?')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["atlanta , georgia ( cnn ) -- lets face it : all the information around cholesterol makes it something of a confusing topic . not only do we make our own cholesterol , but we also must have it to produce other important body assets , such as cell membranes and certain types of hormones . \" good \" cholesterol vs. \" bad \" cholesterol and all the associated numbers can be confusing.so it 's a bodily must-have . but we also augment that inner cholesterol machine by eating foods high in saturated fats such as whole dairy products and red meats and probably half the offerings at any fast-food spot . add to that the fact many people simply overproduce or underproduce cholesterol because of their genes -- and that is just the beginning of the conundrum over cholesterol.but while many ca n't quite wrap their brain around it , the reality is many of us are affected by it , and not in a good way . according to the american heart association , almost half the adult female population in the united states suffers from high cholesterol.add in the good vs. bad cholesterol and all the different numbers for the different levels and it starts making my head spin.fortunately i was able to speak with two very smart cardiologists for guidance.dr . nieca goldberg , a cardiologist in new york , set me straight . she explains it 's all about the balance . \" cholesterol is an important substance and has many benefits for our bodies , but only a set amount keeps your body in a nice situation . \" our bodies make the good and the bad kind of cholesterol , and according to goldberg , who is also a spokeswoman for the american heart association 's \" go red for women \" campaign , they are pretty efficient machines . \" the system is set up so that the hdl high density lipoproteins , or artery-cleaning or 'good ' cholesterol , cleans out the ldl low density lipoproteins , or 'bad ' cholesterol , \" she explains.so , basically the good ushers out the bad by dragging it to the liver , and the liver gets rid of it.but when the bad outweighs the good , that 's when the trouble begins . dr. nanette wenger , chief cardiologist at atlanta 's grady hospital , paints a cheery picture for us . \" cholesterol is this fatty gruelly substance that builds up in the arteries , and when those obstructions have high levels of fat they are much more likely to burst . \" ok , got it : buildup bad , burst worse ! according to the american heart association , the bad cholesterol , with a little help from some other substances in your body , join together and form a united front ( that is , a hard deposit inside your arteries ) that could block the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . or it could block the flow to the brain , causing a stroke . so , it seems that bully bad cholesterol really needs to be shut down . health for her : watch to learn more about cholesterol in women » but how do you do that ? first you have to be informed.wenger says , \" i 've always said that women should know three numbers and there are so many numbers tossed around i think all of us can get confused . but i want my women patients to remember three numbers : 50 , 100 and 150. fifty is the good cholesterol , the hdl -- that should be above 50. one hundred is the ldl , the bad cholesterol . and 150 is the triglycerides , another blood fat , and your triglycerides should be below 150. so be sure that your physician tells you your numbers . if they are fine , do what you do to keep them fine , and if they are abnormal , work with your doctor to change them . \" the first two steps , says goldberg , are about changing your lifestyle . \" you have to adopt a healthy diet and you have to exercise , \" she says . \" people with mild cholesterol problems can usually bring their numbers down just by doing those two things . exercise is one of the most effective measures for raising good cholesterol . \" a low-fat diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids -- found in foods including salmon , walnuts and flax seeds -- is also a good bet for boosting the good stuff . however , sometimes that is not enough . wenger says , \" some people have genetic predispositions and have very abnormal cholesterol . some just make more cholesterol than others , so if your cholesterol is high , it is not that you are a failure . it 's that your lifestyle interventions have not been adequate to get cholesterol to the levels we want . \" sometimes , if warranted , those lifestyle changes need to be helped with medicine . but , cautions goldberg , \" i 've said to my patients , medications alone ca n't do everything . they need to help themselves by modifying their lifestyles with a low-fat diet and exercise , less stress , more sleep , \" all things that we know will keep us healthier longer.so , while in the beginning the cholesterol issue was a conundrum , in the end it 's really a simple story about equipping the good to fight the bad ( on a molecular level ) and making the right choices so my blood wo n't get held back on its travels through my veins.ok , that i get ! e-mail to a

robert hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an omaha , nebraska , shopping mall on wednesday.a police car sits outside the westroads mall in omaha , nebraska , on thursday . \" this is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate , \" said don greene , a former fbi agent who has written a book on mall security . \" if the people closest to him did n't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person ? \" greene asked.in fact , security at omaha 's westroads mall did find hawkins ' behavior suspicious before the shooting , omaha police chief thomas warren said thursday.mall surveillance initially flagged hawkins \" based on his actions \" when he entered the mall through the von maur store 's main entrance on the second floor , warren said . he said hawkins exited quickly after entering , then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.he then went up the elevator to the third floor , and when he got there , he immediately began firing , warren said . \" it does n't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention , \" he said.shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of wednesday 's shooting , which killed eight . watch what experts say about keeping malls safe » \" there is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens , \" said malachy kavanaugh , spokesman for the international council of shopping centers . he said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances , bring in additional officers , and make security more visible.there are 1,200 enclosed malls in the united states and about 50,000 shopping centers . although some include police substations , most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.should these private security guards be armed ? \" absolutely not , \" said greene . greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall , it could result in \" the gunfight at the 'ok corral , ' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight . \" \" these random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur . law enforcement and security prevention measures , no matter how good , can not forestall a tragedy such as this from happening , \" said a statement issued wednesday night by the simon property group , which operates regional and outlet malls across the united states . \" we do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time , some of which are visible to the public , with others intentionally less noticeable , \" the statement said . \" disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment . \" security expert lou palumbo told cnn one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall . \" you start to observe the people coming into the mall area , \" he said . \" to let them in your door and then try to figure out what they 're doing , you know , it 's not as effective as catching them as they 're coming in the door . \" the international council of shopping centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \" airport style \" security measures , including bag checks and magnetometers.according to kavanaugh , the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level , red . such extreme measures are \" in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do , \" said kavanaugh.while some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems , many security experts believe more should and can be done . those experts suggest it 's a matter of money . they say until shoppers start staying away , mall owners will not make significant changes.there are no national standards for security guards , and according to a 2006 study by the police foundation , only a few states require background checks , minimum hiring standards , or training.the study also notes that drills to test security staffs ' knowledge of what to do in an emergency , when done at all , \" are seldom rigorous , seldom done with first responders , and are usually done without clear standards to measure their success . \" the report goes on to say that \" many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert . \" since that report was written , the international council of shopping centers , in conjunction with george washington university , has developed a dvd to train mall security guards . according to kavanaugh , about 6,000 of the nation 's estimated 20,000 mall security guards have participated in the course , including 10 at westroads mall , where wednesday 's shootings took place.the fbi and other federal agencies have reached out to private security firms to share information on best practices . the fbi also sends out alerts regarding possible threats to the private sector -- but warnings of possible terrorist plans are clearly of no help in anticipating an attacker like hawkins . e-mail to a friendcnn 's jeanne meserve , eliott mclaughlin and kelli arena contributed to this report

was ciro fired?')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["( cnn ) -- juventus have sacked coach ciro ferrara after a string of poor results and have installed alberto zaccheroni in the hot seat until the end of the season.ferrara 's position has been threatened after a dismal run which has seen them slip out of contention in the serie a title race as well as being eliminated from the champions league at the group stages.thursday 's 2-1 coppa italia defeat to italian champions inter milan proved the final straw and the club released a statement to confirm his departure and zaccheroni 's arrival . \" zaccheroni will take over the team immediately and will guide this afternoon 's training session in vinovo before being officially unveiled to the media , \" it read.ferrara joined juve late last season and steered the turin powerhouses to second place in serie a behind inter.but his first full campaign in charge proved challenging after a promising start to the season.the bianconeri have lost five of their last six games in serie a and have slumped to sixth in the standings , four points behind napoli , who hold the last champions league qualifying spot.zaccheroni will hope to get them on track with his first game against lazio on sunday.the 56-year-old has coached at a number of leading serie a clubs and helped ac milan to the 1999 italian title , but it is his first job since being sacked by torino in february 2007.ferrara , a former italy international and juventus defender , was given the reins despite his lack of experience , succeeding current roma coach claudio ranieri , who was fired.zaccheroni 's appointment ends , for now , media speculation that liverpool manager rafael benitez would take charge at juve , but the short-term nature of his contract until june raises questions about the permanence of his stay.benitez acknowledged the speculation in his weekly press conference on friday . \" i am focused on preparing my team for the game against bolton . i know they ( juventus ) were interested , that is part of the game now in football , but i am not ready to talk too much because i do n't want to lose my focus . \" when you are a manager and you have clubs asking ( for you ) , you have to be proud because they are a top side in europe , but i am really happy here and want to do my job as best i can . \"\n"]}]}]}
